# UP_review_quote/blurb_cleanup
My program that takes an excel file exported from a university press database and cleans up the raw quote data, then splits it into the text, the source, and the author of the quote.

The additional blurb programs are modifications of the review quote programs to parse a similar file into the text and author.
